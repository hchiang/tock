Since 1.2
=========

* Kernel debug module

  - [#1036](https://github.com/tock/tock/pull/1036),
    [#1029](https://github.com/tock/tock/pull/1036), and
    [#997](https://github.com/tock/tock/pull/1036) change `debug::panic`'s
    signature. First, instead of taking a single LED, `panic` takes a slice of LEDs
    as its first argument. Second, the Rust now uses a `PanicInfo` struct to pass
    along information about where a panic occured, and `debug::panic` adopts the
    same structure. Third, architecture specific assembly code was removed
    from the kernel crate (including the debug module), requiring `debug::panic` to
    take in a particlar implementation of the `nop` instruction. Finally,
    `debug::panic` takes a reference to the process array (it is permissible to
    pass an empty array instead, but you won't get any information about process
    state on panic).

    Boards most likely call `debug::panic` from their `panic_fmt` function:

    ```rust
    #[lang = "panic_fmt"]
    pub unsafe extern "C" fn panic_fmt(args: Arguments, file: &'static str, line: u32) -> ! {
            let led = ...;
            let writer = ...;
            debug::panic(led, writer, args, file, line)
    }
    ```

    should now be:
    ```rust
    use core::panic::PanicInfo;
    ...
    #[panic_implementation]
    pub unsafe extern "C" fn panic_fmt(pi: &PanicInfo) -> ! {[lang = "panic_fmt"]
        let led = ...;
        let writer = ...;

        debug::panic(&mut [led], writer, pi, &cortexm4::support::nop, &PROCESSES)
    ```

* Kernel `struct`: [#1044](https://github.com/tock/tock/pull/1044) creates a
  `Kernel` struct that needs to be instantiated by the board.

  - `Kernel` has a method for the kernel's main loop, instead of a global function in
    the kernel's base module. Board configurations (i.e. each board's
    `main.rs`), as a result needs to instantiate a statically allocate this new
    struct.  Arguments to the main loop haven't changed:

    ```rust
    let board_kernel = static_init!(kernel::Kernel, kernel::Kernel::new());

    board_kernel.kernel_loop(&hail, &mut chip, &mut PROCESSES, Some(&hail.ipc));
    ```

  - `load_processes` takes the `Kernel` struct as an additional first argument:

    ```rust
     kernel::procs::load_processes(
        board_kernel,
        &_sapps as *const u8,
        &mut APP_MEMORY,
        &mut PROCESSES,
        FAULT_RESPONSE,
    );
    ```


* [#1032](https://github.com/tock/tock/pull/1032) updates the ADC HIL to
  explicitly specify the resolution of the sample and to clarify that samples
  are always left-aligned in the `u16` buffer. Previously, the only ADC
  implementation happened to be 12 bits and left-aligned, which callers only
  assumed. It also added a method to (if possible) report the reference
  voltage, which can be used to convert raw ADC samples to absolute voltages.
  Implementers of the ADC HIL must implement two new methods:

  ```rust
  /// Function to ask the ADC how many bits of resolution are in the samples
  /// it is returning.
  fn get_resolution_bits(&self) -> usize;

  /// Function to ask the ADC what reference voltage it used when taking the
  /// samples. This allows the user of this interface to calculate an actual
  /// voltage from the ADC reading.
  ///
  /// The returned reference voltage is in millivolts, or `None` if unknown.
  fn get_voltage_reference_mv(&self) -> Option<usize>;
  ```

* UART HIL Refinements: This release saw several updates to the UART HIL,
  summarized in the [UART HIL tracking issue](https://github.com/tock/tock/issues/1072).

  - [#1073](https://github.com/tock/tock/pull/1073) removes `initialize` from
    the UART HIL. Implementations will need to disentangle board-specific
    initialization code, such as enabling the peripheral or assigning pins,
    from UART configuration code, such as baud rate or parity. Initialization
    is no longer part of the UART HIL and should be performed by the top-level
    board before passing the UART object to any other code. UART configuration
    is now controlled by the new `configure` HIL method:

    ```rust
    /// Configure UART
    ///
    /// Returns SUCCESS, or
    ///
    /// - EOFF: The underlying hardware is currently not available, perhaps
    ///         because it has not been initialized or in the case of a shared
    ///         hardware USART controller because it is set up for SPI.
    /// - EINVAL: Impossible parameters (e.g. a `baud_rate` of 0)
    /// - ENOSUPPORT: The underlying UART cannot satisfy this configuration.
    fn configure(&self, params: UARTParameters) -> ReturnCode;
    ```
